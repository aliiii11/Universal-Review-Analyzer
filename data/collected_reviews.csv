Aug 25, 2025 · The Samsung Galaxy S24 combines a fast processor, a bright display, sharp cameras, and helpful AI tools in a pocket-friendly size for a reasonable price. By PCMag on February 06, 2024 Is the Samsung Galaxy S24 a good phone? At the end of the day, the Galaxy S24 and S24 Plus have great battery life, impressive performance , seven years of software support and some of its Galaxy AI features show promise, but I expect more from the S24 Plus' camera given its $1,000 price. Every phone tested by CNET's reviews team is actually used in the real world. Is the Samsung Galaxy S24 worth buying? The Galaxy S24 delivers some of the strongest value of Samsung’s latest flagships, offering the same Galaxy AI features as its pricier counterparts. Is the Samsung Galaxy S24 better than the Galaxy S23? The Galaxy S24 is the same price as the Galaxy S23, but you get more battery, better performance , and seven years of Android updates this time, so the value is stronger. Admittedly it looks like an iPhone, but it’s also small, light, and thin enough to slip into a front pocket with ease. How long does the Samsung Galaxy S24 last? The Galaxy S24 held out for 13 hours and 28 minutes , with its display set to the default adaptive refresh rate. That's not only 3.5 hours better than the average smartphone's battery test time, it also tops the 10-hour, 27-minute time recorded by the Galaxy S23. What's the difference between galaxy S24 & S24 ultra? There are bottlenecks with both. The Galaxy S24 Ultra technically outperformed the Galaxy S24 , likely due to the extra RAM on board. The Galaxy S24 only ships with 8GB of RAM installed, while the S24 Ultra comes with 12GB. Does the Galaxy S24 have a benchmark? The Galaxy S24 was benchmarked in Future Labs by our resident benchmarking expert, and results were shared and discussed with review editors. Benchmarks do not affect review scores in any way, and are helpful for comparison but not for real-world review purposes. Mar 17, 2024 · Samsung Galaxy S24 Review : Best Compact Phone of the Year?

Apart from a slightly bigger panel and a higher screen-to-body ratio, the Galaxy S24 once again looks very similar to the Galaxy S23. As for specifications, we have something quite interesting under the hood this year. Samsung bravely opted for its own silicon, with the Exynos 2400 SoC, which is paired with its Xclipse 940 GPU. After several years of going with Qualcomm silicon we don't think it is a good idea. But this is better explained in the performance section of this review."

At the end of the day, the Galaxy S24 and S24 Plus have great battery life, impressive performance , seven years of software support and some of its Galaxy AI features show promise, but I expect more from the S24 Plus' camera given its $1,000 price.

The Galaxy S24 is the same price as the Galaxy S23, but you get more battery, better performance , and seven years of Android updates this time, so the value is stronger. Admittedly it looks like an iPhone, but it’s also small, light, and thin enough to slip into a front pocket with ease. How long does the Samsung Galaxy S24 last? The Galaxy S24 held out for 13 hours and 28 minutes , with its display set to the default adaptive refresh rate. That's not only 3.5 hours better than the average smartphone's battery test time, it also tops the 10-hour, 27-minute time recorded by the Galaxy S23. What's the difference between galaxy S24 & S24 ultra? There are bottlenecks with both. The Galaxy S24 Ultra technically outperformed the Galaxy S24 , likely due to the extra RAM on board.
