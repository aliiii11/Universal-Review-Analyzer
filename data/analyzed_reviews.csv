At the end of the day, the Galaxy S24 and S24 Plus have great battery life, impressive performance , seven years of software support and some of its Galaxy AI features show promise, but I expect more from the S24 Plus' camera given its $1,000 price. Every phone tested by CNET's reviews team is actually used in the real world. Is the Samsung Galaxy S24 worth buying? The Galaxy S24 delivers some of the strongest value of Samsung’s latest flagships, offering the same Galaxy AI features as its pricier counterparts. Is the Samsung Galaxy S24 better than the Galaxy S23? The Galaxy S24 is the same price as the Galaxy S23, but you get more battery, better performance , and seven years of Android updates this time, so the value is stronger. Admittedly it looks like an iPhone, but it’s also small, light, and thin enough to slip into a front pocket with ease. How long does the Samsung Galaxy S24 last? The Galaxy S24 held out for 13 hours and 28 minutes , with its display set to the default adaptive refresh rate. That's not only 3.5 hours better than the average smartphone's battery test time, it also tops the 10-hour, 27-minute time recorded by the Galaxy S23. What's the difference between galaxy S24 & S24 ultra? There are bottlenecks with both. The Galaxy S24 Ultra technically outperformed the Galaxy S24 , likely due to the extra RAM on board. The Galaxy S24 only ships with 8GB of RAM installed, while the S24 Ultra comes with 12GB. Does the Galaxy S24 have a benchmark?
